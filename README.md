# Friday Teaming #6 - RPG Combat Kata | Test Commit Revert

In this episode of Friday Teaming we will start the RPG Combat kata in  with TDD, with a twist - this week, we will be 
doing Test Commit Revert (TCR).

Test Commit Revert, or TCR, is a development technique first proposed by Kent Beck in his blog article "test && commit 
|| revert". If the tests pass, then the code is automatically committed. If the tests fail, then all of the changes 
since the previous commit are reverted and you start over.
